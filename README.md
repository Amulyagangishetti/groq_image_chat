Image Query and Caption Generator
# ImageQueryCaption

A Python-based application that generates captions and answers user queries about images. It uses Groq for processing image URLs and queries, and Gradio for building the user interface.

## Features
- Provide an image URL and get a caption for it.
- Provide an image URL and a relevant query, and get a response related to the image.
- If the query is irrelevant to the image, the app will notify you to provide a relevant query.
- Simple Gradio-based user interface.
